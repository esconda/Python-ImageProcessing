Why Computer Vision is so hard?
- Camera Sensors and Limitations(kamera sensör ve limitleri)
- Viewpoint Variations (Bakış açısı varyasyonları)
- Scaling (Boyutlandırma)
- Non-Rigid Deformations(Hareketli olmayan bozulmalar)
- Occlusions(objelerin üst üste binmesi, kapanma)
- Clutter(Dağınıklık, karışıklık)
- Object Class Variations(Obje sınıfı varyasyonları)
- Ambiguous Images/Optical Illısuons(Belirsiz görüntüler, Optik ilüzyonlar)

**Aperture is like the “pupil” for your camera system, which can open and close to change the amount of light that passes through.
Note the nine blades in this lens, which form a diaphragm to block any light that tries to pass, except through the center.
Large aperture taks all light and show brighter image
